shared memory: 
-------------- 

-> shared memory is another formal ipc mechanism which can be used to shared the same memory region across multiple processors. 

posix shared memory: 
-------------------- 

1. create or open posix shared memory with shm_open interface. this will create  new shared memory kernel data structure whose size 
   is zero. 
2. allocte memory for the newly created shared memory object using ftruncate. 
	unsigned int size; 
	size = getpagesize(); 
	ftruncate(shmfd,size); 
3. map the shared memory part of kernel space to process address space using mmap. 
4. unmap the map shared memory after done. 

-> posix shared memory files are already mounted. 
	to look shared memory 
	ls /dev/shm/
