Interrupts:
----------

1. linux kernel configure do_irq() routine as a default response function for all external interrupts.

2. do_irq() is routine of process 0, to which is responsible for allocation of interrupt stack and invoking appropriate interrupt service function.

3. the default interrupt stack is 8k.

interrupt vectors:
------------------

	vector			Description
1. 0 - 19 (0x0 - 0x13)		Non-maskable interrupts & exceptions
2. 20 - 31 (0x14 - 0x1f)	Intel reserved
3. 32 - 127 (0x20 - 0x7f) 	External interrupts(IRQs)
4. 128 (0x80)			system calls exceptions
5. 129 - 238 (0x81 - 0xee)	Externalinterrupts(IRDs)

steps to execute do_irq:
-----------------------
1. find interrupt request line on which interrupt signal was triggered.
2. look up irq descriptor table for registered interrupt service routine.
3. invoke registered ISR
4. enable IRQ line
5. execute other priority work.
6. Invoke process sechudler.

Interrupt latency:
-----------------
Interrupt latency is about total amount of time spend by a system to response a interrupt.

factors contributing to interrupt latency:
-----------------------------------------
1. hardware latency
2. kernel latency
3. interrupt handler latency
4. soft interrupt latency
5. sechudler latency

Designing Interrupt service routine:
-----------------------------------

1. allocate a buffer to hold the packet.
2. copy the packet from device to buffer.
3. process the physical packet.
4. deliver the packet of upper layer.

-> sample sudo code of interrupt handler that response to reception of new packet on network device.
	ISR
	{
		1. allocate buffer.
		2. copy packet from hardware.
		3. process physical header.
		4. queue packet for protocol layers.
	}

-> while implementing ISR the following issues are to be considered.

Dont's:
------
1. Avoid calling dynamic memory allocation routine.
2. Avoid transferring data b/w two buffer blocks synchronusly.
3. Avoid contending for access of global data structure.
4. Avoid operation on user space addresses.
5. Don't called to sechduler.
6. Avoid call to operation which are non atomic.

Do's:
----
1. Allocate buffer(use pre allocated buffer)
2. consider using DMA when ever data to be transffered b/w device and memory.
3. consider using per cpu data wher ever needed.
4. Identify non critical work and use appropratie deffered routine to execute them when system is idel or other sechdule time.

Top Halves and bottom Halves

In last chapter we discussed about Interrupts , how interrupts are handled and registered. In this chapter we will learn what are top halves and bottom halves , what was the limitation of previous implementation of interrupt handler etc.

Limitations On interrupt handler:-

1) It runs asynchronously by interrupting the other code.

2)All interrupt on the current processor disabled.

3)Interrupts are often time critical as they deal with hardware.

4) We cannot block interrupt handler as they run in interrupt context.

Because of all these limitation if our interrupt handling will last for long then our system performance will be less as we won’t able to serve any other request during interrupt handling. So it’s better to shorten the interrupt handling and perform less critical work later.

Interrupt handling is divided into two parts

1) Top Halves:- It is executed as immediate response to interrupt.

2)Bottom Halves:- It is executed some time later when CPU get free time.

Top Halves:- Top halves executes as soon as CPU receives the interrupt . Following work are generally performed in top halves

1) Acknowledgement of receiving the interrupt

2) copy if some data is received

3) if the work is sensitive needs to perform in top halves.

4)If the work is related to hardware needs to perform in top halves.

5)If the work needs to be ensure that another interrupt does not interrupt it , should be perform in interrupt handler.

Everything else is performed in bottom halves . Lets understand Bottom halves in details

Bottom Halves:- Job of bottom halves is to perform the left out work that was not performed by the interrupt handler or top halves. After bottom halves complete their work, It schedule bottom halves for the later time in future whenever our system will be ideal With the time various techniques of bottom halves evolved . Following are types of bottom halves.

 

1) Original “bottom Half”

2)Task Queues

3) Softirq

4)Tasklets

5)workqueus

bottom half:
-----------
1. softirq:
----------
-> statically allocated at compile time.
-> maximum of 32 softirqs.
-> preemption disabled, Interrupts enabled.
-> Activating a softirq.
	- Register softirq with open_softirq()
	- Raise softirq with raise_softirq()
-> Executing a softirq.
	- return from hardware interrupt code
	- by the ksoftirqd thread.
	- code that explicitly checks and executes softirqs

executing of softirq:
--------------------
-> when raise_softirq gets called specified softirq instance is enqueued to the list ofpending softirq(per cpu).
-> softirq are executes by do_irq
-> pending softirq list is cleared by do_irq routine immediately after ISR terminates with interrupts lines enabled.
-> softirq makes secured in the context of ksoftirqd(per cpu kernel threads).
-> resechduling bottom half is required to wellinqush cpu with in a bottom half when a critical resource required for the bottom half execution is not available.

limitations of softirq:
-----------------------
-> softirqs are concurrent that is same softirq could be run on n cpus paralley.
-> while implementing softirq code using mutal exclusion lock is mandatory wher ever needed.
-> using lock in interrupt context code will result in variable time interrupt latency.

2. tasklets:
------------
tasklets are dynamic softirqs that can be used with in module drivers without concurrency(tasklets are always executed serially).

Implementation:
---------------
Tasklets are internally softirq's(HI_SOFTIRQ, TASKLET_SOFTIRQ).
Each tasklet is nothing but a available of tasklet_struct.
using tasklets the following steps are involved.
1. declare tasklet
	DECLARE_TASKLET(name, func, data);
		or
	struct tasklet_struct mytasklet;
	tasklet_init(mytasklet, func, data);
2. Implement BH routine.
	void func(unsigned long data);
3. schedule tasklet
	tasklet_schedule(&mytasklet);
		or
	tasklet_hi_schedule(&mytasklet);

-> tasklets are executed using the same policy that is applied for softirqs since interrupt subsystem of kernel use a tasklet either an instance of type HI_SOFTIRQ or TASKLET_SOFTIRQ.
-> Interrupt subsystem gaurantee the following which regards executio of tasklets
	1. when schedule function tasklet_schedule() is called, then tasklet is gauranteed to be executed on some cpu at least once after this.
	2. if the tasklet is already scheduled, but its execution is still not started, it will be executed only once.
	3. if this taskletis already running on another cpu(or schedule is called from tasklet itself), it is rescheduled for later.
	4. tasklet is strictly serialized wrt itself, but not wrt another tasklets. if client needs some inter task synchronization, he makes it with spinlocks.

3. work queues:
---------------
-> work queue is process context bottom half.
-> when we have longer operations in bottom half work queue is most favourite option.
	1. Declare work queue
		DECLARE_WORK(wq, (work_func_t)wq_func);
			or
		INIT_WORK(wq, wq_func, 0);
	2. Implement BH routine
		void wq_func(void *arg);
	3. schedule work queue
		schedule_work(&wq);
		schedule_delayed_work(&wq, DELAY);

work queue timer:
-----------------
static struct timer_list my_timer;
static int len =100;
init_timer(&my_timer);
my_timer.function = my_timer_function;
my_timer.expires = jiffies+HZ; /* one sec delay*/
my_timer.data = len;
add_timer(&my_timer);
